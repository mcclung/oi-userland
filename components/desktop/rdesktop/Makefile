# Really, this is not the stated version as releases are based on the 1.8.x
# branch but require libgssglue, which we don't want to package as it's
# obsolete in the master branch anyway. For Kerberos we use native GSS-API.
# So, version 1.8.99 is to be read as development version before 1.9.0 is out.
